Warnings encountered during the last execution of ms3 review
============================================================

DCML_NON_CHORD_TONES_ABOVE_THRESHOLD_WARNING (19, 8, '13/8', 'V7/vi') ms3.Parse.frescobaldi_fiori_musicali.1228_Toccata_avanti_il_Recercar
	The label 'V7/vi' in m. 8, onset 13/8 (MC 8, onset 13/8) seems not to correspond well to the score (which does not necessarily mean it is wrong).
	In the context of d.i, it expresses the scale degrees
	('3', '5', '7', 'b2') [('F', 'A', 'C', 'Eb')].
	The corresponding score segment has 0 within-label and 4 out-of-label note onsets,
	a ratio of 1.0 > 0.6 (the current, arbitrary, threshold).
	If it turns out the label is correct, please add the header of this warning to the IGNORED_WARNINGS, ideally followed
	by a free-text comment in subsequent lines starting with a space or tab.
